About this repository.

I was introducted to the SOI index a few years ago. 
I have generated an automated medium range weather forecast model for the United States based on the daily change of the index. 
I have broken down the current model to a bare necessity engine. I envision many improvements. 
I anticipate collaboration with other enthusiasts of the SOI daily change who also enjoy programming.

Currently the engine is coded in Microsoft Excel using Visual Basic for Applications. 
To get started download the .xlsm file and read the 'how-to' tab. 
Let me know if you need assistance with any of this. 
I am new to GitHub and learning how it works. Any advice would be appreciated.
